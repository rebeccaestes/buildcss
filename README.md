Think I'm missing something? Examples are easy to write: just make an html and a markdown file with the same name, and open a pull request.

#### Contribution Guidelines

* Be concise, clear, and accurate. Never pedantic.
* Most exercises should be simple. The challenge is to understand how and why.
* The audience is junior devs. Backend heavy devs who "don't get" CSS may find it helpful as well.
* Try to stick to features that are supported by most modern browsers. I'm trying to help people get shit done.
* The last page is *other resources*. If you have links to brilliant things, pass them to me.
