# Box Model

MDN has a pretty good [intro to the box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model).

This one should be self explanatory.

One note: read about [box-sizing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing), a CSS property that determines, well, exactly what you need.
