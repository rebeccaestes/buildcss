# And I'm done here

Of course, you're just getting started. The best way to learn how to build shit in CSS
is to go forth and build lot's of shit.

But if you're looking for more resources, I like these:

1. [Froggy Flexbox](http://flexboxfroggy.com/). Flexbox is in its infancy, and pretty counterintuitive,
but it's (probably) the future of layout. 
2. Ethan Marcotte has written two excellent books on responsive design with A Book Apart: [Responsive Web Design](http://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design) and [Responsive Patterns and Practices](http://abookapart.com/products/responsive-design-patterns-principles). (And really, most of A Book Apart's catalogue is awesome).
