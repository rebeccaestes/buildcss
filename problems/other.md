# I'm done here, but you're just getting started

The best way to learn how to build shit in CSS 
is to go forth and build websites.

But if you're looking for more resources, here's some good stuff:

1. [Froggy Flexbox](http://flexboxfroggy.com/). Flexbox is in its infancy, and pretty counterintuitive,
but it's (probably) the future of layout. 
2. Ethan Marcotte has written two excellent books on responsive design with A Book Apart: [Responsive Web Design](http://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design) and [Responsive Patterns and Practices](http://abookapart.com/products/responsive-design-patterns-principles). (And really, most of A Book Apart's catalogue is awesome).
