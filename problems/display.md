# Display

This is about the [Display](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) property.

You should make it entirely with divs or spans, and use CSS
properties to control them.


## Notes:

* Inline elements are text, like `<b>` and `<a>`. They have no padding, margins or floats. They sit on the same line.
* Block elements like `<div>` and `<p>` fill the whole line by default, and stack on top of each other. They have margins and padding.
* Inline-blocks have margins and padding like blocks do, but sit on the same line like inline elements.

You'll use all three to build the above.

Good luck!
